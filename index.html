    <h2> A little about me:</h2>
    <p>As a wee lassie, I spent my days in Missoula, Montana, making snow forts and dreaming of the outside world. In high school, I discoverd the French language and studied in France for a year. I completed a (very marketable) bachelor's degree in French Literature, so I continued on and earned a Master's in Linguistics. This enabled me to travel the world teaching English as a second language to the masses.  I fell in love with a handsome Tunisian I met in an Irish pub in Abu Dhabi, and ten years and two kids later, we are happily settled in my favorite U.S. city, Portland. My family and I have fun taking trips to the ocean, and chilling with our kitties Lassie and Mango.

    I tought ESL for over 12 years and enjoyed it, but in recent years I began to feel restless and unchallenged. I started to play around with some online bootcamp prep sites, and realized how much fun it was to code. I could make a machine do what I want just by typing! After careful research, I decided on attending Epicodus, where I learned more in the first week than I could have imaginged. I look forward to a new career as a web developer, and can't wait to learn more.
